# Simple-API
 
A simple python API using Flask and flask-restful, which populates the data from csv files in the directory.

*__An additional config.py file is utilized that is not present in this project, used to store the directory housing the CSV files, in a variable called 'path'__*

Run the app by using
```
python api.py
```

Once the server has started, you can access the API via Postman or web browser by using either of the following URLs:
* http://127.0.0.1:5000/users
* http://127.0.0.1:5000/locations
